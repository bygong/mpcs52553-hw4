1. For the domain modeling, I've added a new model called "role.rb", which makes a many-to-many relationship between movie and actor.

2. In the seeds file, I moved the movie initialization above and added code for relating role and movie. And also hardcoded the actors of Apollo 13.

3. For other movies I just added three random actors to them.

4. For director and actors lists, instead of listing their works next to them I just gave each of them a link to another "show" page which lists a detailed information of their works. I think this is more intuitive, hopefully wouldn't lose points on it.
